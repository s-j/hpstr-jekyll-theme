Hi there! I am Simon Lia-Jonassen, a software engineer at Microsoft and information technology enthusiast living in Sandvika, Norway. In past, I've done a PhD on query processing efficiency in distributed search engines at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no) and been lucky to do lots of interesting things at [UNINETT](https://www.uninett.no/), Sun Microsystems, Yahoo! Labs and [Cxense](http://www.cxense.com). I love engineering and playing with equations, frameworks, bits and visual data, which I hope to write more about in [this blog](http://s-j.github.io). Some of older and more serious writings and talks can be found [here](http://s-j.github.io/publications/).
