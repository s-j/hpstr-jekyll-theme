Hi there! I am Simon. I've done my PhD on query processing efficiency in distributed search engines at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no) and now work as a software engineer at [Cxense](http://www.cxense.com), where we do lots of cool stuff. I love engineering and playing with equations, bits and visual data, which I hope to write more about in [this blog](http://s-j.github.io). Some of more serious writings and talks can be found [here](http://s-j.github.io/publications/).
