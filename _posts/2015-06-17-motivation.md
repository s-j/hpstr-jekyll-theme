I know lots of people who were passionate about computers since they were just little kids. I wasn't. I wanted to be a chief officer (seaman), a lawyer, a scientist or a graphical designer at different parts of my childhood. The first piece of code I wrote in 2002 was something like this (this is a CASIO fx graphical calculator with a BASIC dialect).

13 years later I work as a programmer - but it is not the passion for computers that drives me forward. It is helping people to solve their problems, and of course getting a chance to put some simple mathematics into it :)
