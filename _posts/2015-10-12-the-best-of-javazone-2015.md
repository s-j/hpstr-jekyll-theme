Yet another year, and yet another [Javazone](http://2015.javazone.no/) - as always lots of food, new people, old friends and many interesting talks. Long story short, here is my top-5 the most entertaining talks:

1. [Java 8 JVM Memory and Thread Management](https://vimeo.com/138955223) by Ken Sipe – a very good explanation of the Java memory model and some practical tips.
2. [Coding Culture](https://vimeo.com/138873440) by Sven Peters – a set of very good suggestions on how to create a great work place for developers.
3. [The Rule of Three](https://vimeo.com/138863968) by Kevlin Henney – as always, a hilarious talk about everything and nothing.
4. [Building a Carputer: Java and teh Automotive Internet of Things](https://vimeo.com/138763193) by Simon Ritter – Java, Raspberry Pi and an Audi S3 - how awesome can it be?
5. [Production time profiling On-Demand with Java Flight Recorder](https://vimeo.com/138740676) by Klara Ward – nuff said!

Two more talks for those specially interested in the JVM internals:

1. [The Illusion of Execution](https://vimeo.com/138863976) by Nitsan Wakart.
2. [Java Concurrency Under The Hood](https://vimeo.com/138867185) by Gleb Smirnov.

And two more interesting talks for my Norwegian-speaking friends:

1. [Skrivetips for utviklere](https://vimeo.com/138852532) by June Henriksen.
2. [Anbefalinger fra Apache Mahout til Spark MLlib på 4 steg i FINN.no](https://vimeo.com/138748695) by Helge Jenssen.
